                </h3>
                <p>
                    Religion was the most important aspect of Puritan culture.
                    Because of this, they had strict rules concerning it, one
                    of those was making church mandatory. Punishment would
                    start at loss of food and end at whipping or even worse.

                </h3>
                <p>
                    Puritan society was essentially founded on their religion.
                    As a result, anything disparaging towards their religion
                    was taken very seriously. Punishment could be being forced
                    to wear a "B", whipping, or even capital punishment.

                </h3>
                <p>
                    Rules were a big part of Puritan society. So much so that
                    just sacrificing what you owned was valued. As a result not
                    paying taxes was treated extremely harshly just like in most
                    modern societies. Taxes were extremely important to them
                    however because the funds were used to support the church.

                </h3>
                <p>
                    A common trait of Puritans was superstition. Because of that
                    and their combined hatred of anything that could be
                    interpreted as evil, they hater witches. People believed to
                    be witches were usually executed.

                </h3>
                <p>
                    Puritans valued appearance and collectedness. Public
                    drunkeness was looked down on because it showed a lack of
                    formality. The punishment was generally public humiliation in
                    the form of wearing a letter "D". Some punishments that
                    occured lasted from a day up to a year.

                </h3>
                <p>
                    Adultery is a crime in which a man or a woman has sex
                    outside of marriage. It is punished by forcing the adulterer
                    to wear a scarlet letter "A". And in more extreme instances,
                    whipping or execution.
